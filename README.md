This is an Expo / React Native Web application that I use as my portfolio site.

## Stack
- React Native Web
- Typescript
- Redux Toolkit

## Goals
- Integrate with a CMS.
  - Currently the content is hard typed, which makes updating a bit tedious.
- Expand details on previous projects
- Create in-app experience for reading blog articles, instead of linking to Medium straght away.
